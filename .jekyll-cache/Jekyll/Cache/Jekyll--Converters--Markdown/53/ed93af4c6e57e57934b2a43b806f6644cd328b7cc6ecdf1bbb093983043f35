I"Ì<p>Well, good morning :wave: - I hope that youâ€™ve been enjoying the exploits over these last few
posts. Iâ€™m casually aware that there are a <em>lot</em> of similar articles out there discussing the
hand-rolling of front-end frameworks, and that what Iâ€™m doing here may be no different. That
being said Iâ€™ve enjoyed the writing of it, so if at least one other person has found this
useful/entertaining then Iâ€™m a <em>reasonably</em> happy chappy!</p>
