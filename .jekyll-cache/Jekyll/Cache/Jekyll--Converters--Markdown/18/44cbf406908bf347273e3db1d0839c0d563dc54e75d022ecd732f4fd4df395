I"ﬂ<p>So I thought it might be a good idea to start including technical stuff in this technical/developer blog.  Fairly recently,
my best friend moved to gay Paris for business.  Before leaving the country, we‚Äôd established a fun tradition of having a few
drams and playing chess (invariably ending in a weird stalemate, and an extended game of ‚Äúcatch the king‚Äù)‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Since moving to France; I‚Äôve very much missed our whisky-fuelled encounters, and increasingly looked to technology to fill this
gap in my life!</p>

<p>Enter GitHub pages.  GitHub provides (gratis, I might add), an environment into which you can push blog articles, project pages,
and all manner of such nerdy joy.  I thought it could be an interesting experiment to try and subvert this process into a fun,
green-text, correspondence-based chess engine!</p>

<p>Utilising chesstempo.com‚Äôs <em>excellent</em> javascript chess-rendering software (<a href="http://chesstempo.com/pgn-viewer.html"> over here</a>),
I‚Äôve created a new GitHub repo which wraps this in a format that means you can create a correspondance chess game via git.  Take
a look over at <a href="https://github.com/thesheps/chess">the github project</a> for further details, if you fancy it!</p>
