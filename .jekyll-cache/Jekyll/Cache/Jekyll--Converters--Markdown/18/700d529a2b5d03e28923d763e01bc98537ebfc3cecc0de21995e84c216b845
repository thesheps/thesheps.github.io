I"<p>So yesterday I embarked on this mad, audacious goal of trying to create a front-end
framework from the ground-up using TDD and TypeScript. For those of you whoâ€™d like
to refresh your memory, you can find the original blog post <a href="https://medium.com/@thesheps/lets-build-a-thing-part-one-7b29e4f8e955">here</a>. But what does the world look like
today? Well. There was midnight oil burned and coffee drunk. There was trashy
background TV watched and lots of lovely downtime. My Trello board now looks liiiiike
this!</p>
