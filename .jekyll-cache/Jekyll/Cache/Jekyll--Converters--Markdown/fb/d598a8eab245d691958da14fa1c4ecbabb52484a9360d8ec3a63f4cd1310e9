I"<p>The summer sun - seemingly a fleeting acquaintance this year, has bid farewell; leaving behind it chillier mornings, a craving for carbohydrates,
and a fizzling-out sense of motivation…</p>

<p>I realise I should probably find some project, technology or research area to fill my time, but where to start?  Is it necessary always to spend
your personal time sharpening the blade and cracking the whip?  Is it actually of any benefit?  Should I instead sink into textbooks and research papers?
Learn from others’ learning?</p>
