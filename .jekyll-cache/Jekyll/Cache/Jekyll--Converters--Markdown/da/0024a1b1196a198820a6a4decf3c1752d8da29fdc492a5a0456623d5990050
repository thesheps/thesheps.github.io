I";<p>You can buy <em>anything</em> online these days.  More to the point - you can buy incredibly more awesome things, in a manner more 
timely and absurdly convenient than I ever thought possible.</p>

<p>Just last week, a colleague and I entered into an arrangement with an online coffee delivery company 
(<a href="http://www.pactcoffee.com">here’s looking at you, Pact!</a>)  For an introductory price of just one English quid, 
I got delivered a 250g bag of vacuum-packed Columbian espresso; replete with tasting notes, and ground that same day specifically 
for Aeropress consumption.</p>

<p>Similarly - as a 30th birthday present, my wife bought me a subscription to <a href="http://flaviar.com">Flaviar.</a>  A dangerous
thing indeed; they send you a “tasting pack of stuff” every month.  My first pack, “Star Spangled Bourbon”, included a whole host
of incredible Kentucky moonshine - all with tasting notes, in a sexy little presentation box.</p>

<p>These companies have all recognised that convenience is money, and giving power and choice to the consumer opens the door to referrals
and breathy, word-of-mouth endorsement.</p>

<p>As admittedly awesome as all these things are, will there eventually be a time when “standard” supermarket coffee doesn’t hit the spot
any more?  Will I look back at this post in 2 years time - laughing at my lack of foresight as I eat a vacuum-packed, artisan cheese 
sandwich; washed down with artisan milk from vacuum-packed, artisan cows?</p>
