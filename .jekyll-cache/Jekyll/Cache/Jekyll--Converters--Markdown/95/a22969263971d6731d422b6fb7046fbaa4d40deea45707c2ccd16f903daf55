I"I<p>I started this blog with the intention of contributing back to the community any thoughts and learnin’s I’ve picked up
over the years.  The main problem with this is that I get the impression everything has already been discussed,
debated and blogged about to the point of exhaustion.  So what’s left to contribute?</p>
