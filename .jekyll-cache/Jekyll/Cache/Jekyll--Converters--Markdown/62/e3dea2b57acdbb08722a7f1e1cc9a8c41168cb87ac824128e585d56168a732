I"À<p>I started this blog with the intention of contributing back to the community any thoughts and learninâ€™s Iâ€™ve picked up
over the years.  The main problem with this is that I get the impression everything has already been discussed,
debated and blogged about to the point of exhaustion.  So whatâ€™s left to contribute?</p>

<p>For me; software development started as a hobby at the age of about 12, thumbing through my sisterâ€™s GCSE computing homework
and hacking together Pascal programs with one of my friends.  This then lead to developing websites for various bands I was
in, and eventually to learning Java and .Net throughout university and out into the Big Wide World.  Throughout all this time
Iâ€™ve always been stumped by the question: â€œWhatâ€™s next?â€</p>

<p>When I worked in Professional Services, this question was driven by whichever project I was working on next.  This predicated
all the technology stack, the timescales, and any pre-sales work or presentations Iâ€™d have to work on for the next client.  Moving
into in-house software development I was often provided with ample slack during which Iâ€™d read up on patterns and frameworks (GoF,
different communication frameworks etc).  But as Iâ€™ve moved between different companies; the learning emphasis has shifted somewhat.
Instead of simply up-skilling on different coding paradigms and patterns, there feels to be more of a focus on dev-ops and 
integration concerns.  What scripting language do you use for build tasks?  How do you reduce your build time to ensure your pipeline
doesnâ€™t get congested?  How do you negotiate releases across teams so as to manage dependencies?</p>

<p>Whereas I used to return home and spend more time developing pet projects in order to â€œwrite more codezâ€ and subsequently sharpen
my tools; now I find myself increasingly more burnt-out by the daily melee, and wondering if thereâ€™s â€œsomething more to be doneâ€.</p>

<p>When do you stop learning?</p>
