I"6<p>I’ve been trying to get out and do Park Runs for about 9 months or so now.  It gets me out of the house, and
gives me something to do on a Saturday morning, other than just marinating in my own juices…</p>

<p>So today I went out and did my first Park Run as a 30 year old - I figured it’s a habit I really want to stick.
I’ve not managed to get out for a little while, chiefly owing to having been away for a few weeks on honeymoon
and then the inevitable catching up with real life, friends etc which comes from having been away for a bit.</p>

<p>Although it wasn’t the <em>hardest</em> run I’ve ever done (sub 25 minutes-ish), towards the end I really felt I just wanted 
to give up.  There’s nothing worse than wanting to finish strong but not having enough in your tank.  It was 
all I could do to keep plodding heavily along, wishing for it all to be over as quick as possible.  But then I 
encountered one of those incredible moments that make my local Park Run so special.  A runner passed me wearing 
one of the red Park Run “50 races landmark” tshirts, locked eyes with me, and shouted “Come on mate, get stuck in - you’re doing really well!”  It was a much-needed boost that for some reason really helped me to dig deep and 
find some energy I didn’t realise I had!</p>

<p>To any of you out there thinking of running, please do get out there and get involved with your local Park Run;
it’s an absolutely incredible community of nutters, who’ve all been where you are now and want you to be the
best you can.</p>

<p>So thanks, running man!</p>
