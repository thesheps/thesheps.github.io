I started this blog with the intention of contributing back to the community any thoughts and learnin's I've picked up
over the years.  The main problem with this is that I get the impression everything has already been discussed,
debated and blogged about to the point of exhaustion.  So what's left to contribute?

For me; software development started as a hobby at the age of about 12, thumbing through my sister's GCSE computing homework
and hacking together Pascal programs with one of my friends.  This then lead to developing websites for various bands I was
in, and eventually to learning Java and .Net throughout university and out into the Big Wide World.  Throughout all this time
I've always been stumped by the question: "What's next?"

When I worked in Professional Services, this question was driven by whichever project I was working on next.  This predicated
all the technology stack, the timescales, and any pre-sales work or presentations I'd have to work on for the next client.  Moving
into in-house software development I was often provided with ample slack during which I'd read up on patterns and frameworks (GoF,
different communication frameworks etc).  But as I've moved between different companies; the learning emphasis has shifted somewhat.
Instead of simply up-skilling on different coding paradigms and patterns, there feels to be more of a focus on dev-ops and 
integration concerns.  What scripting language do you use for build tasks?  How do you reduce your build time to ensure your pipeline
doesn't get congested?  How do you negotiate releases across teams so as to manage dependencies?

Whereas I used to return home and spend more time developing pet projects in order to "write more codez", I'm finding myself
increasingly worried by the gaps in my knowledge with regards to delivery.


When do you stop learning?
