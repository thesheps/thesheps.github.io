Oops, it's happened again!  Once more I've started a blog, run out of things to say and subsequently let the entire thing rot away.  Apologies!  In my defense
I've been a busy boy both at work and home, and have been progressing a few fun projects which appear to have taken all my creative efforts.

So what is there to say?  Well, following the advice @john-chapman I have indeed once again deep-dived into the terrifying landscape of c++.  It's been refreshing
to be presented with coding challenges other than "make sure this configured correctly for each environment" (more on that later).

John and I are attempting, (however foolishly), to write from-scratch programming language.  We'll be communicating any advancements or exciting developments in a 
separate development blog [here](http://thesheps.github.io/plang/).  Please do ignore the pretentious opening gambit, I'm sure there'll be some additional content there
sometime soon, possibly when we've fleshed out the language parser in a bit more depth.

C'est tout.
