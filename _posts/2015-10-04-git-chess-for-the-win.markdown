So I thought it might be a good idea to start including technical stuff in this technical/developer blog.  Fairly recently,
my best friend moved to gay Paris for business.  Before leaving the country, we'd established a fun tradition of having a few
drams and playing chess (invariably ending in a weird stalemate, and an extended game of "catch the king")...

Since moving to France; I've very much missed our whisky-fuelled encounters, and increasingly looked to technology to fill this
gap in my life!

Enter GitHub pages.  GitHub provides (gratis, I might add), an environment into which you can push blog articles, project pages,
and all manner of such nerdy joy.  I thought it could be an interesting experiment to try and subvert this process into a fun,
green-text, correspondence-based chess engine!

Utilising chesstempo.com's *excellent* javascript chess-rendering software (<a href="http://chesstempo.com/pgn-viewer.html"> over here</a>),
I've created a new GitHub repo which wraps this in a format that means you can create a correspondance chess game via git.  Take
a look over at <a href="https://github.com/thesheps/chess">the github project</a> for further details, if you fancy it!
