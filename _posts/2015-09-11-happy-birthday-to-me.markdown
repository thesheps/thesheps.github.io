Well I thought it a reasonably appropriate time to start a development blog on this, the day of my 30th birthday. 
I'll definitely attempt to keep this up to date with any musings I may have, at least once a week (gulp...)

So today has marked another turning point in my life.  Although just another year, the big three-zero does seem to
bear the weight (at least in my mind) of responsibility, sobriety, adulthood.  No longer in my fancy-free 20s, is it
time to knuckle down and take things a bit more seriously?  Possibly.

A colleague of mine with whom I've been pairing on a few projects has recently left for pastures new.  A bit of a guru,
with tonnes of experience; it was great to be able to compare and contrast our experiences.  Although he came equipped
with a whole bunch of experiences with different frameworks, patterns, technology stacks, ceremonies and the like;
there was a single piece of advice he gave me which seemed to really hit home:

> Slow Down.

There's a weird pressure I've felt when pairing with another developer (of any level), where I've felt myself second-guessing
my decisions.  Perhaps due to some weird insecurity, perhaps out of a need to try and impress other people; I've felt
myself bending under the strain of the scrutinisation of my navigator.  Although this tends to work out favourably in
the main (the "extra pair of eyes" effect); I've often found it to hamper progress and indeed sometimes *completely derail*
my train of thought.

By consciously trying to re-train myself to slow down, and appreciate the fact that my partner is *in this with me*
I'll hopefully be able to let go and stop my brain from getting in the way... of my brain.
